This is a working copy of the example terraform scripts for working with Instance Pools.  This has been edited to work with Terraform 0.12+.

Note that this set of scripts requires several policy statements to be added to the OCI tenancy to function:


1)  Allow service compute_management to use tag-namespace in compartment <compartment>

	This corrects for failures due to a known issue with defined tags, this is only a workaround and the core problem will be corrected eventually.


2) Allow group <group> to manage compute-management-family in compartment <compartment>

	Apparently without this explicit grant, the non-admin users are not able to create the instance pool.


3) Allow group <group> to use instance-pools in tenancy

	Grant to allow use of instance-pools, does NOT work without the statement listed in #2
